# Simone-Says-Game
This project is a recreation of the classic "Simon Says" game. The objective is to follow and repeat a sequence of colors or sounds in the same order they are presented. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging. It's a fun way to test and improve your memory and concentration skills!
